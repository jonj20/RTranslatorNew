If you want to contribute to RTranslator but you don't know where to start, here is a list of possible things to do:

| Description | Status |
| -------- | ------- |
| Night mode theme. | Not started |
| Mic manual mode setting to choose whether to start with automatic or manual mic mode in WalkieTalkie or Conversation mode (separate settings for the two modes). | Not started |
| Button to stop and eventually repeat the TTS in the messages of WalkieTalkie and Conversation mode. | Not started |
| A new section in the settings that shows the version of the app, plus link to the releases of the app that also show if there is a new version. | Not started |
| A new option in the settings to show, in WalkieTalkie and Conversation modes, the original transcription of the message beyond the translation. | [Started](https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator/pull/125) |

<br/><br/>
Here is also a list of more difficult things to do if you want (I don't expect to do one of these all by yourself, even pull requests that lay down the foundations or a one that do a small contribution about these features are higly appreciated):

| Description | Status |
| -------- | ------- |
| Improvements to the Bluetooth LE comunication system, especially ones that add the capability of working reliably even without restarting Bluetooth after a disconnection or an error. For now this is foundamental to make the Bluetooth communication work reliably. The new APIs of Android however, blocks the possibility of turning on or off bluetooth programmatically, that's the main reason that keeps RTranslator away from the Play Store (where the new APIs of android are required). | Not started |
| Adding a new mode dedicated to transcriptions only, that saves the transcriptions like notes and has the capability of editing their text, adding more text via transcriptions ecc. (maybe even add transcriptions using audio files). | Not started |

<br/><br/>
The possible states are: Not started (you can open a new pull request), Started (with the link of the pull request) and Done.
